To add a new video category, add a new folder within the 'video' directory.

The folder name will become the category name.



To add a new video file, place the .flv file within the appropriate

category folder within the 'video' directory.  The page will remove the

'.flv' from the end and put the file name in the link title.



With all folder and file names, please use underscores in place of spaces

or the links on the video player page will not work. The page automatically

masks the underscores, so don't worry about visitors seeing them.


For example:

Category_Name_with_Spaces
+	How_to_Eat_a_Potato.flv
+	What_Should_I_Wear.flv
Another_Category
+	Famous_Whales_of_the_Atlantic.flv
+	The_Meaning_of_Life.flv
+	This_is_Boring_-_Don't_Watch_It!.flv

The script automagically removes the underscores and file extensions
when making the links on the page, but keeps them in when referring
to the actual file path.
